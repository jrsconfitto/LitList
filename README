LitList
========

This web app allows users to create and edit their own personal reading list.

To get started, open index.html then click the plus icon at the bottom of the empty To Read list to add your first book. 

If on a wide display device, click the To Read or Done Reading list headers to see an expanded view of each list.

The Progress and Profile links in the navigation menus are for future additons to the site and do not currently lead anywhere.
